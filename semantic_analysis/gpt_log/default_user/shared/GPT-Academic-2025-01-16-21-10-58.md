          "@type": "indicator",
          "content": "The AST Parser must be fast and efficient, capable of handling large codebases while minimizing memory overhead. It should also be highly accurate, producing an AST that is a correct representation of the original code. Performance optimizations for large Python files are crucial."

It should provide detailed information about how changes in one part of the program can affect other areas. It should also scale well for large, modular codebases."
