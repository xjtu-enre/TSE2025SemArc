# TSE2025SemArc
This repository contains dataset for the paper "Software Architecture Recovery Augmented with Semantics".
The dataset consists of eight ground-truth datasets sourced from existing research and seven additional datasets created by us. These datasets cover three different programming languages and vary in sizes, providing a comprehensive set of real-world examples for software architecture recovery tasks.

The ground-truth folder is organized as follows:
````
└─ground-truth
    ├─collected
    └─labeled
└─semantic_analysis
└─SemArc
````
- **collected**: This folder contains datasets sourced from existing research, providing a reliable foundation for evaluating architecture recovery methods.
- **labeled**: This folder includes the datasets created by us, where the ground-truth architecture has been manually labeled and validated. These datasets are designed to cover a wide range of system sizes and programming languages, ensuring a diverse set of examples.
